## 🍬 Hooks
- allows function components to access _**state**_, _**lifecycle**_ methods, and other React features
- allows function components to replaces class components
- must **import** hooks from react, example ```import {useState} from "react";```
- can only be called _**inside**_ react function components
- can only be called at the _**top**_ level of component
- _**cannot be conditional**_
- does not work in class components, only function component

### :point_right: useState
- destructuring ```import {useState} from "react";```
- initialization ``` const [color, setColor] = useState("");```
  - accepts 1 initial state ```useState("red")``` or could be empty ```useState("")```
  - returns 2 values: the current state, function name that updates the state ```[color, setColor]```
- read state like a variable in rendered component ```{color}```
- update state use update function defined previously ```{()=>setColor("blue")}```
  - can be used to keep track of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects, etc..
  - when state is updated, **_entire_** states gets overwritten
  - when update array or object, js spread operator need to be used if only update part of the array/object
