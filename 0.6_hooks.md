## üç¨ Hooks
- allows function components to access _**state**_, _**lifecycle**_ methods, and other React features
- allows function components to replaces class components
- must **import** hooks from react, example ```import {useState} from "react";```
- can only be called _**inside**_ react function components
- can only be called at the _**top**_ level of component
- _**cannot be conditional**_
- does not work in class components, only function component

### :point_right: useState
- destructuring ```import {useState} from "react";```
- initialization ``` const [color, setColor] = useState("");```
  - accepts 1 initial state ```useState("red")``` or could be empty ```useState("")```
  - returns 2 values: the current state, function name that updates the state ```[color, setColor]```
- read state like a variable in rendered component ```{color}```
- update state use update function defined previously ```{()=>setColor("blue")}```
  - can be used to keep track of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects, etc..
  - when state is updated, **_entire_** states gets overwritten
  - when update array or object, js spread operator need to be used if only update part of the array/object
  - ‚ùì what is js spread operator
- Example
  ```javascript
  import { useState } from "react";
  
  function FavoriteColor() {
    const [color, setColor] = useState("red");
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Color is {color}</h1>
        <button type="button" onClick={() => setColor("blue")}>Blue</button>
      </div>
    )
  }
  ```

### :point_right: useEffect
- destructuring ```import { useState, useEffect } from "react";```
- ```useEffect(<function>, <dependency>)```
    - accepts 2 inputs, dependency is optional
- runs on every render when component change
- allows side effects on components such as fetching data, directly updating the DOM, and timers
- cleanup: Timeouts, subscriptions, event listeners, and other effects that are no longer needed should be disposed.
- no dependency
  ```javascript
  useEffect(() => {
    //Runs on every render
  });
  ```
- empty dependency
  ```javascript
  useEffect(() => {
    //Runs only on the first render
  }, []);
  ```
- prop or state or a variable as dependency
  ```javascript
  useEffect(() => {
    //Runs on the first render
    //And any time any dependency value changes
  }, [prop, state]);
  ```
